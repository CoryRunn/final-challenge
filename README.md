This is the Final Challenge from Kevin Powell's "Coding Responsive Layouts 21-day Challenge" course.

The challenge is to use everything we learned from this course (FLEXBOX!!!!) and build the layout from the included PDF file. The desktop design is supplied and you must decide on how the mobile version should be layed out.
